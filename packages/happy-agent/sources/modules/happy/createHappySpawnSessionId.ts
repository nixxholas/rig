 * The session id one spawn request always resolves to.
 *
 * The phone retries a request it has not heard back about, and it must not get
 * a second session for it, so the id is derived from the request rather than
 * invented. Two daemons on one computer derive different ids from the same
 * request, which is what keeps their sessions apart.
 *
 * The digest is written in hexadecimal because this becomes a conversation id,
 * and those are lower-case; base64 would sometimes produce a name the catalog
 * refuses, and only sometimes, which is the worst way for it to fail.
