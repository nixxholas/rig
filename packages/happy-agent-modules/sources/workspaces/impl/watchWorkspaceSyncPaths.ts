/**
 * Watches the project root's copies of the configured sync paths, best-effort.
 *
 * Every observation funnels into one callback: the caller re-reads the configuration, re-arms the
 * watch, and replicates everything, so a watch that fires spuriously or coarsely still converges.
 * Watches are armed on parent directories rather than the files themselves because editors
 * replace files by renaming over them, which leaves a file watch following a dead inode; paths
 * sharing a parent share one watch. The project configuration files are watched the same way so
 * a changed sync list is picked up without a restart.
 *
 * A synced directory's contents are watched recursively only where the kernel backs recursive
 * watching; on Linux, Node emulates it with one inotify watch per directory, which an arbitrarily
 * large tree would turn into real resource use. There, and for a path that cannot be watched at
 * all, sync degrades to catching up when some watched path fires.
