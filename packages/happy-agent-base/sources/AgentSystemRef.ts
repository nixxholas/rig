/**
 * A reference to a collection of agents that cannot deadlock, for code that runs inside an agent
 * — a module hook, or a tool the run loop is waiting on. Every operation returns without
 * waiting for any agent's loop to reach a particular point.
 *
 * What is missing is missing on purpose. `delete` closes an agent and `start` resumes whole
 * agents; both are the owning caller's business, and both would wait for a loop that may be
 * waiting for the very code asking. Agents come back as `AgentRef` for the same reason — handing
 * out the real `Agent` would hand back `close` and `waitForIdle` along with the `await: true`
 * that waits for a compaction or an unwound turn.
 *
 * A message is the one thing a caller here may be told about, because accepting one is a durable
 * queue write rather than a turn: `steer` and `send` resolve once the message is safely part of
 * the target agent's conversation, and reject when that write fails, so a caller routing work to
 * another agent knows whether it arrived. The exception is the caller's own agent, whose loop is
 * what would have to perform that write — asked for itself, the message is queued and not waited
 * for. That is decided from the context, which names the agent the caller is running inside; a
 * context that names none proves nothing, so nothing is waited for there either.
