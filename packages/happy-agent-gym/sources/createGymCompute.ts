 * The machine a gym gives the agent instead of this computer.
 *
 * It is a just-bash shell and filesystem answered inside this process, mounted over the one folder
 * the agent was configured to work in. Commands run, files change, and `gym.readFile` sees the
 * result, but nothing outside that folder exists and no process is ever started on the host.
 *
 * The agent is told this is its host machine, because that is the substitution a gym makes: the
 * model is scripted and the machine is emulated, and everything between them — the loop, the
 * tools, the permissions, the daemon, the database — is the real product. A test that needs the
 * real host boundary belongs in a suite that starts the agent with the host compute instead.
